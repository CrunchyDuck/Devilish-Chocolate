# **Devilish Chocolate**
## **A RimWorld mod for chocolate intake management**


A mod that adds chocolate (And milk chocolate if the Slightly More Realistic Chocolate Production mod is detected) to the Drug Policy's options.
As a byproduct, this means people with the "Teetotaler" trait will not eat chocolate/milk chocolate.

This was originally made just for myself, but I decided to release it for anyone else who may find use in it.

Utilizes the wonderful ModCheck in order to patch without adding a dependancy.
